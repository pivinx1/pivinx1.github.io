            <p>Building stuff for this platform sure is an interesting task, mainly because knowledge for it is nowadays quite scarce.</p>
            <p>Probably the first thing to do would be to obtain some tools.</p>
            <div id="checklist">
                <h3>You will need:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Any version of Visual Studio between 2005 and 2010 (Visual Studio 2008 worked best for me), must be the Professional version.
                        You can get it from the Internet Archive <a href="https://archive.org/download/dev-microsoft-visual-studio-2005-2015-Pro/en_visual_studio_2008_professional_x86_dvd_x14-26326.iso">here</a>.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        An SDK (Software Development Kit) for your version of Windows Mobile of choice.
                        Do note that versions targeted towards older versions of Windows Mobile <em>should</em> work on newer versions.
                        You can get one from the Internet Archive <a href="https://archive.org/details/WMSDK">here</a>.
                    </li>
                    <li>The .NET <strong>Compact</strong> Framework 2.0 installed on your development machine</li>
                </ul>
                <p>You can omit any item on the list below as needed.</p>
                <h3>Additionally:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>A Windows Mobile device of choice (mine was the HP iPAQ 214)</li>
                    <li>ActiveSync (on Windows XP and older) or Windows Mobile Device Center (on Windows Vista and 7) for syncing your program onto your device of choice</li>
                </ul>
                <p>You don't need to have a Windows Mobile device on hand.</p>
                <p>Visual Studio 2008 comes with the Device Emulator, which can emulate a Windows Mobile device as needed.</p>
                <p>Your SDK should come with the ROM images for the Device Emulator by default.</p>

                <h3>The Code</h3>
                <p>As a matter of fact, writing code for the Windows Mobile platform at it's base is not much different from writing code for the Win32 platform.<br>
                Windows Mobile is based on Windows CE, but it supports both the Win32 API but in addition also supports the WinCE API. <br>
                Because of this, using the Win32 API for writing your app will allow an user to run your app on a Windows PC as well.</p>
                <p>However, do note that some file-related things may become inherently broken due to fundamental differences in the filesystems of the desktop Windows platform and the Mobile desktop platform.</p>

                <h4>Differentiating Windows Mobile Version Types</h4>
                <p>
                    There were three main versions of Windows Mobile, each targeted at different kinds of hardware.
                    For Windows Mobile 6.0 to 6.5, it is as follows:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Professional, which runs on smartphones with touchscreens, 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Standard, which runs on cellphones <strong>without</strong> touchscreens,
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Classic, for things such as personal digital assistants (PDAs) or Pocket PCs, which were the original target of Windows Mobile.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    However, earlier versions of Windows Mobile instead used these names:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Pocket PC (i.e Pocket PC 2000) or Windows Mobile for Pocket PC (i.e Windows Mobile 2003 SE for Pocket PC)
                        This is the equivalent of the later (5.0-6.x) Classic versions.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Pocket PC Phone Edition (i.e Pocket PC 2000 Phone Edition) or Windows Mobile for Pocket PC Phone Edition (i.e Windows Mobile 2003 SE for Pocket PC Phone Edition)
                        This is the equivalent of the later Professional version.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Smartphone (Smartphone 2002, Pocket PC 2000 had no Smartphone variant) or For Smartphone (i.e Windows Movile 2003 SE for Smartphone)
                        This is the equivalent of the later Standard version.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    In most cases, apps should be able to operate seamlessly between version. Though you should probably still test whether this is actually the case.
